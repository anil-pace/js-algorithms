# js-algorithms
A way to becoming a great developer could be tied to how well you are able to solve algorithm questions.
This Repository contains solutions to popular JavaScript Algorithm questions.
Feel free to add your sollutions.
I hope to write my thought process on medium on how these solutions work.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository into your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/seunzone/js-algorithms.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```
yarn install
```
3. Run jest test for each algorithm, refer to the `package.json` file <br>
Palindrome Test: `yarn run palindrome` <br>
Reverse String Test: `yarn run rev-str` <br>
Reverse Integer Test: `yarn run rev-int` <br>
Maximumn Character Test: `yarn run maxchar` <br>
FizzBuzz Test: `yarn run fizzbuzz` <br>
